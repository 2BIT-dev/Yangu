            <h3>Design & Development</h3>
            <p>I started learning to code when i was 17 years old because i wanted to know how to build my own games.
                Overtime i have gained a wealth of experience designing and developing websites and web applications.I also shifted to learn scripting lately aiming to solve or automate boring stuff using python.</p>

            <h3>CHESS</h3>
            <p>To me chess is a motivator than a boring game as most people perceive. One of the my best quotes about
                chess is <q cite="https://www.ichess.net/shop/chess-improvement-simon-williams/">The beauty of chess is
                    it can
                    be whatever you want it to be. It transcends language, age, race, religion, politics, gender, and
                    socioeconomic background. Whatever your circumstances, anyone can enjoy a good fight to the death
                    over the chess board.</q> </p>
